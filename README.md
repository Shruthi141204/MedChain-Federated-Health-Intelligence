# MedChain-Federated-Health-Intelligence

This is a prototype for demonstrating how federated learning can be used in healthcare sector    
we use a ecg dataset from kaggle for demo training (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devavratatripathy/ecg-dataset) (dataset have been uploaded too)    
the code is just a prototype but can be used for demonstration purposes
